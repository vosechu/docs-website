To create a new New Relic organization, go to [newrelic.com/signup](https://newrelic.com/signup). A New Relic organization gives you free access to our entire [observability platform](https://newrelic.com/platform).

If you want to add accounts to an existing organization, see [Organization structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure).

## Sign up [#sign-up]

When you sign up for a New Relic organization, you have access to New Relic for free and forever. Sign up in a few minutes at [newrelic.com/signup](http://newrelic.com/signup). Or, if you have a specific offer from a [New Relic partner](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-based-installation/log-install-new-relic-partners), use the link they've sent you.

Next steps after signing up:
